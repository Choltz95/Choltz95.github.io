<H1>Chester Holtz</H1>
I am a final year undergraduate student at the University of Rochester, majoring
in Computer Science (B.S.) with a minor in Mathematics. I am doing research in machine
learning and data science in VISTA under the supervision of Professor <a href="http://www.cs.rochester.edu/u/jluo/"target="_blank">Jiebo Luo</a>. 
I am also involved with Professor <a href="http://www.cs.rochester.edu/u/kautz/" target="_blank">Henry Kautz's</a> SNAP group and RocNLP.

My current research interests include machine learning, optimization and related
applications, and I would like to pursue a Ph.D. after my undergraduate study. 

My paper, "A Machine Learning-based Approach to Autism Spectrum Disorder", 
will appear in the 2017 edition of The Journal of Bioinformatics and Systems Biology

My current projects include:
- Robust Emoji Representation and Prediction
- Analysis of Politically Charged News Items
